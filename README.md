# Preliminary Data and Code for "Prototyping AI-assisted immersive data visualization and analysis in virtual reality with VR-AI-ment"

This repository holds a Unity project with initial code for this proposed work. The house model used for this pre-visualization comes from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com) user *Zhenya* and is available at [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/autumn-house-52772448c62348e0a4951b51758d5587](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/autumn-house-52772448c62348e0a4951b51758d5587). The humanoid model comes from Sketchfab user *VolDe Maar (Padawan 3D)* and is available at [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/robot-k-vrc-11ca2a59002b4c64986b44e46f389b47](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/robot-k-vrc-11ca2a59002b4c64986b44e46f389b47).
